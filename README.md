TL;DR: AmputatorBot is a Reddit bot that replies to comments and submissions containing AMP URLs with the direct and original link.

## Why AMP is a threat to the Open Web
**What is AMP?** AMP is an open-source web component framework aimed at improving the UX of websites, stories, ads and mail. It was first announced by Google in 2015 and has grown considerably since then. But the project has also been subject to a lot criticism.

**AMP threatens the Open Web.** For example, Google mobile Search’s Top Stories carousel has a premium position above of all other results, which is only accessible for cached AMP pages. This has the effect of further reinforcing Google’s dominance of the Web.

Other concerns include: the questionable performance boost, the way cached AMP pages keep users in Google's ecosystem, the obscurity of publishers's domains on cached AMP pages, the loss of sovereignty of websites, the lack of functionality and diversity on some AMP pages and of course, privacy concerns.

To sum up, AMP and it's implementation have some major flaws that threaten the Open Web. And as long as that's the case, [u/AmputatorBot](https://www.reddit.com/u/AmputatorBot/) and [AmputatorBot.com](https://www.amputatorbot.com/) will be there to remove AMP from your URLs.
