# AmputatorBot
TL;DR: AmputatorBot is a Reddit bot that replies to comments and submissions containing AMP URLS with the direct and original link.

## Why AMP is bad for everyone
TL;DR: Google’s AMP is a major threat to the Open Web and your privacy.

AMP means “Accelerated Mobile Pages” and is a framework designed to make websites faster. In many cases, it does exactly that. However, it comes at a high price.

AMP is a **massive power-grab by Google** that threatens the Open Web. AMP was developed in secret alongside some news corporations. By the time it was made, Google’s spec and infrastructure were basically settled and non-negotiable. And now Google is [prioritizing AMP pages in their search results](https://www.socpub.com/articles/chris-graham-why-google-amp-threat-open-web-15847). This forces more and more companies to implement AMP, increasing the power of an already huge and monopolistic company.

And while Google is increasing their control over the internet, **you’re losing control over your privacy**. Google’s entire business model is about collecting as much personal data as possible. AMP is just another tool to do so. As described in [Google’s Support article](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/7220196?hl=en):
> When you use the Google AMP Viewer, **Google and the publisher that made the AMP page may each collect data about you.**

To protect the Open Web and your privacy, u/AmputatorBot provides the direct link (bypassing Google) by replying to Reddit comments and submissions.

## Support the project
AmputatorBot is a really important project for me and I want to spend as much time and resources into accomplishing it's goal: to make people aware of the dark side of AMP and to give people a choice. You can support the project in a couple of ways:

**Donate to cover the costs**
If you have some spare change laying around, you could make a small donation to keep the servers running. You can donate via PayPal by clicking on this link: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=EU6ZFKTVT9VH2&source=url. It costs €8.26 per month to host the bot 24/7. You can fill in any amount of money, but don't feel obligated to donate much, I'm just trying to cover the costs.

**Give feedback and contribute**
If you have some spare time laying around, please give me feedback! You can:
- [Reply in the FAQ post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmputatorBot/comments/c88zm3/why_did_i_build_amputatorbot/)
- [Submit a post with a feature request or bug report](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmputatorBot/submit)
- [Fill an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/KilledMufasa/AmputatorBot/issues)
- [Make a pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/KilledMufasa/AmputatorBot/issues)

**Summon the bot**
Have you spotted an AMP link in a submitted page or comment? Mention u/AmputatorBot in a reply and I'll do my best to share the direct source (just remember that this won't work on the non-working subreddits).

Thanks for the tremendous support you've given me and u/AmputatorBot <3
