TL;DR: Remove AMP from your URLs. [AmputatorBot](https://github.com/KilledMufasa/AmputatorBot) is a highly specialised [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/AmputatorBot)
and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AmputatorBot) bot that automatically replies to comments, submissions
and tweets containing AMP URLs with the canonical link(s). It's also available as a
[website](https://www.amputatorbot.com/) and [REST API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/12422626/UVC3n93T), but those haven't been made open source here.

## Features

![#AmputatorBot demo](/img/amputatorbot_demo.png)

### Main features:
- **10 specialised canonical-finding methods, allowing for an accuracy rate of +97%**. For example, by:
  - Scanning the HTML contents
  - Detecting and following redirects
  - Guessing, and then checking article similarity with [newspaper](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper/)
  - â€¦ and many more!
- Detect AMP links using 14 patterns, and reply to items containing them with the canonical link and some info
- Compare and test canonicals and pick the best
- Stream Reddit comments, submissions, inbox messages and Tweets
- Extensively tested using a (private) database of over 200K AMP links and their canonicals, also functioning as caching

### Nice bonuses:
- Detect unique URLs with [URLExtract](https://github.com/lipoja/URLExtract) and strip them of any artifacts
- Object-oriented, allowing for a handy, free and publicly available API
- Allow users to opt out and undo this
- Send DMs when summoned by a user
- Items interacted with are automatically being tracked
- Log and datafiles are automatically generated
