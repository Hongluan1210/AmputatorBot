## Set up

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies
3. Fill in and change the required values in static.txt (see /static)
4. Change the filename of static.txt to .py
5. Choose which script(s) you want to run (check_comments.py, check_inbox.py or check_submissions.py)
6. Set the 'settings' in the run_bot function of the script. Set everything (guess_and_check, reply_to_post, write_to_database) to False when starting out.
7. Run the script - All logs and required datafiles will be automatically and dynamically created. In /data: allowed_subreddits.txt, comments_failed.txt, comments_success.txt, disallowed_mods.txt, disallowed_subreddits.txt, disallowed_users.txt, mentions_failed.txt, mentions.success.txt, np_subreddits.txt, problematic_domains.txt, submissions_failed.txt, submissions_success.txt and in /logs: check_comments_X.X.log, check_inbox_X.X.log and check_submissions_X.X.log.
8. Stop the script to see and edit the newly generated files. Odds are you want to add subreddits to allowed_subreddits.txt (for example: ,subreddit1,subreddit2)
9. Re-run the script
