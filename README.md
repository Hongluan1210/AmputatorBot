TL;DR: AmputatorBot is a Reddit bot that replies to comments and submissions containing AMP URLs with the direct and original link.

## Why AMP is bad for everyone
**TL;DR: Google’s AMP is a threat to the Open Web and your privacy.**

AMP means “Accelerated Mobile Pages” and it's a framework designed to make websites faster. In many cases, it does exactly that. However, it comes at a high price.

AMP was developed in secret alongside some major news organisations. By the time it was released, Google's specs and infrastructure were essentially settled and non-negotiable. And now Google is prioritizing AMP pages in their search results and they only allow AMP pages to appear on their news carousel. **This forces more and more organisations to implement AMP, thereby increasing the power of an already huge and monopolistic company.** This makes Google's AMP a major threat to the Open Web.

And while Google is increasing their control over the internet, **you’re losing control over your privacy**. Google’s entire business model is about collecting as much personal data as possible. AMP is just another tool to do so. As described in Google’s Support article:

> When you use the Google AMP Viewer, **Google and the publisher that made the AMP page may each collect data about you.**

**This is unacceptable**. To protect the Open Web and your privacy, [u/AmputatorBot](https://www.reddit.com/u/AmputatorBot/) provides the direct link (bypassing Google) on Reddit and [AmputatorBot.com](https://www.amputatorbot.com/).
