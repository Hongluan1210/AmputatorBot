TL;DR: AmputatorBot is a Reddit bot that replies to comments and submissions containing AMP URLS with the direct and original link.

## Why AMP is bad for everyone
TL;DR: Google’s AMP is a major threat to the Open Web and your privacy.

AMP means “Accelerated Mobile Pages” and is a framework designed to make websites faster. In many cases, it does exactly that. However, it comes at a high price.

Google's AMP is a major threat to the Open Web. AMP was developed in secret alongside some major news organisations. By the time it was released, Google’s spec and infrastructure were basically settled and non-negotiable. And now Google is [prioritizing AMP pages in their search results](https://www.socpub.com/articles/chris-graham-why-google-amp-threat-open-web-15847) and [they only allow AMP pages to appear on their news carousel](https://adactio.com/journal/15726). **This forces more and more organisations to implement AMP, thereby increasing the power of an already huge and monopolistic company.**

And while Google is increasing their control over the internet, **you’re losing control over your privacy**. Google’s entire business model is about collecting as much personal data as possible. AMP is just another tool to do so. As described in [Google’s Support article](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/7220196?hl=en):
> When you use the Google AMP Viewer, **Google and the publisher that made the AMP page may each collect data about you.**

To protect the Open Web and your privacy, [u/AmputatorBot](https://www.reddit.com/u/AmputatorBot/) provides the direct link (bypassing Google) by replying to Reddit comments and submissions.

## Support the project
AmputatorBot is a really important project for me and I want to spend as much time and resources into accomplishing it's goal: to make people aware of the dark side of AMP and to give people a choice. You can support the project in a couple of ways:

**Donate to help me cover some of the costs**
If you have some spare change laying around, you could make a small donation to keep the servers running. You can donate via PayPal by clicking on this link: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=EU6ZFKTVT9VH2. It costs €8.26 per month to host the bot 24/7. You can fill in any amount of money, but don't feel obligated to donate much, I'm just trying to cover the costs.

**Give feedback and contribute**
If you have some spare time laying around, please give me feedback! You can:
- [Reply in the FAQ post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmputatorBot/comments/c88zm3/why_did_i_build_amputatorbot/)
- [Submit a post with a feature request or bug report](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmputatorBot/submit)
- [Fill an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/KilledMufasa/AmputatorBot/issues)

**Summon the bot**
Have you spotted an AMP link in a submitted page or comment? Mention [u/AmputatorBot](https://www.reddit.com/user/AmputatorBot) in a reply and I'll do my best to share the direct source (just remember that this won't work on the non-working subreddits). More info about this feature can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmputatorBot/comments/cchly3/you_can_now_summon_amputatorbot/).
