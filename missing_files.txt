These files will not be shared to prevent spam and doxing.
Besides, these files will be automatically created by the 3 python scripts (except for the forbidden_users.txt one, since this file is used dynamically by all scripts).

And if you're lost on config.py, I've made a template for you: https://github.com/KilledMufasa/AmputatorBot/blob/master/config.py
