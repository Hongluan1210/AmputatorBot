# This wonderful little program is used by u/AmputatorBot
# (https://www.reddit.com/user/AmputatorBot) to scan u/AmputatorBot's
# inbox for opt-out requests, opt-back-in requests and mentions.
# If AmputatorBot detects an AMP link in the parent of a mention
# a reply is made with the direct link, the summoner receives a DM.
# If a user opts out, the username will be added to a dynamic file
# which will be confirmed with a DM.
